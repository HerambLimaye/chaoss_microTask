1. Micro-task 1:

Research knowledgebase plugins for WordPress (current version and updates)

A knowledge base plugin allows you to easily publish documentation, tutorials, and how-to articles. You can organize these resources efficiently while keeping them apart from your blog and landing pages.

I researched and found that these two plugins available on wordpress are best for knowledgebase :

**Better Docs**

**Knowledge Base for Documentation and FAQs**

2. Micro-task 2:

Create a WordPress site. The site doesn't need to have real content but it should include dummy content (lorem ipsum...), navigation elements, and styling that complements the chaoss website.

I have created and hosted following website with the help of WordPress. It is only basic prototype.

3. Micro-tasks 3:

Implement two knowledgebase plugins (free versions) on your WordPress site. If you are recommending a plugin that costs money, please reach out to a mentor to discuss.

I could not integrate plugins that I found without upgrading to premium, but I have researched about them and I am pretty confident that I can integrate them in a website

4. Micro-tasks 4:

Create a report to present the results of your micro-tasks and your proposal for implementing a knowledgebase on the CHAOSS website. Document the plugins and describe your design choices. Include links to your example implementations on your WordPress site.
