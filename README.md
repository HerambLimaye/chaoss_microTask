# chaoss_microTask

1. Micro-task 1:

Research knowledgebase plugins for WordPress (current version and updates)

2. Micro-task 2:

Create a WordPress site. The site doesn't need to have real content but it should include dummy content (lorem ipsum...), navigation elements, and styling that complements the chaoss website.

3. Micro-tasks 3:

Implement two knowledgebase plugins (free versions) on your WordPress site. If you are recommending a plugin that costs money, please reach out to a mentor to discuss.

4. Micro-tasks 4:

Create a report to present the results of your micro-tasks and your proposal for implementing a knowledgebase on the CHAOSS website. Document the plugins and describe your design choices. Include links to your example implementations on your WordPress site.
